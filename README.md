# CCf-CertProj-01-Survey
Project done for Responsive Web Design Certification from freeCodeCamp


##Aim of the project:
The goal of this first project was to build a webpage representing a survey form.
-It had to be a personal work, using the knowledge learned through previous lessons. 
-It had to be build using html5 and css3.
-It has to have certain amount of text fields, email fields, 
-The form has to finish with a submit button.
I was left free to decide upon colours and styles of the form.
## Website:
In this repository you can see the code of the project (index.html and styles.css). 
If you wonder how does the website look like, I made it live through my profile on github.
