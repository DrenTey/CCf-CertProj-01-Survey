# CCf-CertProj-01-Survey
Project done for Responsive Web Design Certification from freeCodeCamp


## Aim of the project:
The goal of this first project was to build a webpage representing a survey form.
The main conditions as far as I remember were:
- It had to be a personal work, using the knowledge learned through previous lessons. 
- It had to be build using html5 and css3.
- It has to have certain amount of text fields, email fields, 
- The form has to finish with a submit button.
I was left free to decide upon colours and styles of the form.
## Website:
In this repository you can see the code of the project (index.html and styles.css). 
If you wonder how does the website look like, I deployed it  (making it live) through one of the options of profile on github.

Currently it can be seen also as a small internal website (iframe) on my website of my profile on github where I try to put recent project.
